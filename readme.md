# sar_dataset
Dataset composed of 105 SAR images of roads and their corresponding road network graphs. The dataset was constructed for a data science project at CentraleSupélec [1]. The project is a second year engineering school (equivalent to senior year of college in the US system / 1st year of Master in the UK system) project of CentraleSupelec engineering school (Paris-Saclay University) in France.

## Dataset Characteristics

### SAR images

The roads present in the dataset were mainly taken from large roads in the countryside, where the road is clearly visible in SAR imagery. The images were acquired through GoogleEarthEngine from the Sentinel-1 satellites. The **satellite acquisition characteristics** are listed below:
- Processing level: Level 1 GRD (Ground Range Deteced)
- Transmitter-receiver polarisation: VV (Vertical transmit, Vertical receive)
- Instrument mode: IW (Interferometric Wide (IW) swath)
- Resolution: 10 x 10 m

The SAR images have 352 x 352 pixels and are named `region_x_sat.png`.

### Graphs
The graphs are generated by Sat2Graph's [2] encoding algorithm, which fetches road network information through OpenStreetMap. 

The ground-truth graph images are named `region_x_gt.png`. They can be easily processed and used for image segmentation.

The ground-truth graph information interpretable by Sat2Graph [2] is stored as `region_x_refine_gt_graph_samplepoints.json`, `region_x_refine_gt_graph.p` and `region_x_graph_gt.pickle`.
